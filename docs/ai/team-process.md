# Team process for AI-assisted work

- The person who opens a PR owns it and must be able to explain every change without AI.
- Commits made by an agent end with `Assisted-by: <tool>/<model>` and, when there's a spec, `Spec: specs/<id>`.
- Keep PRs under 600 changed lines (CI enforces it; the `large-pr` label overrides).
- Run at most 2 or 3 agents in parallel per person.
- Don't use "skip permissions", "YOLO" or auto-run modes in any tool.
- Keep secrets out of the repo folder; inject them at run time.
- Review the metrics and the `m-learn` changes (`git log --grep 'chore(learn)'`) once a month. Re-check `AGENTS.md` and `docs/ai/` after every React Native, Xcode or Android Gradle Plugin upgrade, and after switching AI models.
